# Client for CoinMarketCap - App for iOS & Android
"Client for CoinMarketCap" has a number of different features, but its most notable one is its ability to track the prices of multiple digital currencies on the market. You can follow prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and many other currencies from exchanges such as Coinbase, Bitstamp, Bitsquare, Kraken, and other. View charts, price index, and more! The CryptoCurrencies can be arranged by Price by Market cap, Percentage change for 24hours, available supply and more. This app also has a minimal chart so you can see how the currency fluctuated during a certain time frame from 1hour to 2years depending on your settings. This app connects to a variety of different exchanges for crypto-currencies. To put it simply: conmarketcap.com as an app!
